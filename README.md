# ChatScript.vim
Vim syntax for [ChatScript](https://github.com/bwilcox-1234/ChatScript) topic files.

# Why
I develop all my software possibly using vim editor on a terminal.
There is not a standard ChatScript syntax highlight for vim, so I created this one.

My aim is to use colors to help ChatScript _scriptors_ (authors/developers) to highlight different syntax elements and lower down coding errors.
By example I chose clear different colors for variables `$permanentvar`, `$$transientvar`, `$_localvar`. 


## Screenshot
### Without ChatScript.vim

In the screenshot here below, how is visualized a topic file (.top), as a standard text file (no colors!)

### Using ChatScript.vim

In the screenshot here below, how is visualized a topic file (.top), using ChatScript.vim syntax highlight, with monokai colorscheme

## How to install

### Manually

The easiest installation method is to place 

* syntax/ChatScript.vim script into your ~/.vim/syntax/ directory.
* ftdetect/ChatScript.vim script into your ~/.vim/ftdetect/ directory.

### With a plugin manager 

I love [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager. 

```vim
" ChatScript.vim syntax highlight 
Plug 'https://github.com/solyaris/ChatScript.vim'
```

## Changes
- in v.2. regex are a bit better. 
- I experimented direct assignement of colors. 

## Todo & Contributions
I'm not a vimL expert and neither a (vim) regex nerd. 

- [x] basic coloring, differentiate: functions, topics, rules, patterns, literals sentences.
- [x] using different colors for different kind of variables types.
- [ ] use _regions_ for a better contextual syntax highlight.

Any suggestion/pull request welcome! Please feel free to contact me via mail for any point.
